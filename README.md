## Outline

Python is a general purpose programming language that is useful for writing scripts to work effectively and reproducibly with data.

This is an introduction to Python designed for participants with no programming experience. This course covers:

* Some basic information about Python syntax.
* The Jupyter notebook interface.
* How to import CSV files.
* Using the Pandas package to work with data frames.
* How to calculate summary information from a data frame.
* Brief introduction to plotting.
* How to work with databases directly from Python.

During the first part of the course, we will use our workstation or laptop to run the exercises. On the second day, we will log in to ARCHER2 and learn how to use a supercomputer to run our Python scripts.
